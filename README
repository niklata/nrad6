INTRODUCTION
------------

nrad6 provides router advertisement and DHCPv6 information services that
are required for stateless autoconfiguration to properly function for
hosts.  It is intended to be run on a router; IPv6 assumes that the
default gateway for a network will provide router advertisements, and
many hosts will need stateless DHCP6 information replies in order to
determine the DNS and NTP services for a network.

nrad6 has been designed to be secure and function with minimal privilege.

REMARKS ON IPv4 AND IPv6 DIFFERENCES
------------------------------------

IPv6 is very different than IPv4.

IPv6 supports two different methods (stateful, stateless) of automatic IP
address allocation.  IPv4 only supports stateful allocation.

Stateful allocation is the familiar DHCPv4 approach, where a centralized
server has authority for IP address allocation on a set of
local network segments.  Hosts make queries to this server and are
provided with IP addresses by the server, which records the mappings
(state) between hosts (identified by MAC or IAID/DUIDs) and IP addresses.

DHCPv6 can support this model, but it is not the preferred model for IPv6.

IPv6 stateless address allocation eliminates the need for a centralized
server to keep track of mappings between hosts and IP addresses.  Instead,
information about the network (prefix, dns/ntp servers) is provided to
hosts by routers on the local network segment (link).  Hosts use this
information to calculate a probabalistically unique IP address, which
is then verified for uniqueness by interrogating the network (using
IPv6 Neighbor Discovery/Duplicate Address Detection).

DHCPv6 can be used in the stateless model to provide network details
such as the IP addresses of recursive DNS or NTP servers.  DHCPv6 is
not strictly required for stateless autoconfiguration to function, but
many hosts require it to be available in order for them to discover
DNS or NTP addresses.  Router advertisments can carry this information,
but the options were defined in 2010 and many hosts do not yet
understand these options.

nrad6 is designed to support the stateless autoconfiguration model.
It provides all functionality required stateless autoconfiguration to
fully function for hosts.  It should be run only on IPv6 routers,
and only on interfaces on the router for which the router performs
routing duties.

STANDARD USAGE
--------------

1) Compile and install nrad6.
    a) mkdir build
    b) cd build
    c) cmake ..
    d) make
    e) Install the nrad6 executable in a normal place.
    f) Set up a user and chroot path (optional, but recommended).

2) Run nrad6.  Use nrad6 --help to see all possible options.

    Examples:

        nrad6 --interface=eth0 --interface=eth1 --user=nrad6 \
              --dns-server=ffff::1 --dns-server=fffe::1 \
              --dns-search=example.net --chroot /var/empty

HOST COMPATIBILITY
------------------

Windows needs DHCPv6 in order to autoconfigure DNS and NTP server
addresses.  OS X instead uses the RDNS or NTP options in router
advertisement ICMPs.  nrad6 provides both by default.

PORTABILITY
-----------

nrad6 could be ported to non-Linux systems, but will require new code
to replace the netlink mechanism used in Linux.  Some security hardening
features (seccomp-bpf syscall filtering, SO_LOCK_FILTER) would need to
be disabled, too.
